# Coursera developing data products final project

##Introduction
This repository was created to hold the files for my Coursera developing data products class final project. It contains the files for the shiny application:

* ui.R
* server.R

and the associated R presentation: week4.Rpres.

Of course, this README.md file is also included.

# Shiny application
The shiny application fits a linear model of the car's MPG using a user defined set of predictors available in the data set (all variables in the dataset apart from the MPG, of course).

* The predictor variables is selected in the sidebar and 4 discovery plots and model summary are displayed in the main panel. The output is reactive so you can select your predictors and see how well the model fits.

The Shiny application is deployed on ShinyApps.io at: https://diverguy.shinyapps.io/coursera_developing_data_products_final_project/

# Presentation
The final project assignement also includes to create a 5 page R presentation.

The RStudio presentation slides is published on RPubs at: https://diverguy.shinyapps.io/week4/
